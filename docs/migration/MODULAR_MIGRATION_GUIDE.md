# ðŸ”„ MODULAR MIGRATION GUIDE

## Overview
This guide details the step-by-step process for migrating from the monolithic ESG platform to the new modular architecture. It covers preparation, execution, validation, and best practices for a safe and effective migration.

---

## 1. Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation
- **Backup** the entire monolithic codebase and database.
- **Document** the current structure, dependencies, and module boundaries.
- **Set up** the new directory structure (`Monolithic_ESG` and `Modular_ESG`).
- **Review** the architecture and implementation plans.

### Phase 2: Module Scaffolding
- **Create** empty module directories under `repositories/` using the migration script.
- **Initialize** each module with `package.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `src/` and `tests/` folders.
- **Set up** shared libraries in `shared-libraries/@gnanam/`.

### Phase 3: Code Migration
- **Migrate** one module at a time (start with interest rate risk).
- **Copy** relevant code from the monolithic source to the new module.
- **Refactor** code to fit the modular interface and structure.
- **Update** all import paths and dependencies.
- **Write** or update module documentation.

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- **Run** unit and integration tests for each module.
- **Validate** module APIs and contracts.
- **Perform** cross-module integration tests.
- **Fix** any issues and ensure all tests pass.

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
- **Set up** CI/CD pipelines for each module.
- **Conduct** performance and security testing.
- **Update** all documentation and migration records.
- **Prepare** for production deployment.

## 2. Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup monolithic codebase
- [ ] Document current structure and dependencies
- [ ] Create new directory structure
- [ ] Scaffold all module directories
- [ ] Set up shared libraries
- [ ] Migrate code for each module
- [ ] Refactor and update imports
- [ ] Write module documentation
- [ ] Run and pass all tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Validate integration and performance
- [ ] Update all documentation

## 3. Best Practices
- **Incremental migration**: Move one module at a time, validate before proceeding.
- **Version control**: Use Git for all changes, commit frequently.
- **Testing**: Maintain high test coverage throughout migration.
- **Documentation**: Update docs at every step.
- **Rollback plan**: Always have a backup and rollback strategy.
- **Team communication**: Keep all stakeholders informed.

## 4. Troubleshooting
- **Build errors**: Check import paths and dependencies.
- **Test failures**: Review test data and refactored logic.
- **Integration issues**: Validate API contracts and shared library versions.
- **Performance drops**: Profile and optimize migrated code.

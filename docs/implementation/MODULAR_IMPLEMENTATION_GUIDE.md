# ðŸš€ MODULAR IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions, standards, and best practices for implementing the modular ESG platform. It is intended for developers, architects, and contributors.

---

## 1. Project Structure

- **Monolithic code**: `My_Projects/Monolithic_ESG/`
- **Modular code**: `My_Projects/Modular_ESG/Gnanam_ESG/`
- **Modules**: Each risk, core, and infrastructure module is in its own directory under `repositories/`.
- **Shared Libraries**: Common code in `shared-libraries/@gnanam/`
- **Documentation**: All docs in `docs/` subfolders.

---

## 2. Module Development Workflow

### a. Create a New Module
1. Scaffold a new directory under `repositories/` (use the migration script or copy an existing template).
2. Add `package.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `src/` and `tests/` folders.
3. Register the module in the root `package.json` workspace list.

### b. Implement Module Logic
- Place all business logic in `src/`.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Follow the interface contracts defined in shared libraries.
- Keep module APIs clean and well-documented.

### c. Testing
- Write unit tests in `tests/unit/`.
- Write integration tests in `tests/integration/`.
- Use Jest (or Pytest for Python modules) for test automation.
- Maintain >90% code coverage.

### d. Documentation
- Each module must have a `README.md` and, if needed, a `docs/` folder.
- Document all public APIs, configuration, and usage examples.

## 3. Shared Libraries
- Place all shared types, utilities, and contracts in `shared-libraries/@gnanam/`.
- Use semantic versioning for shared libraries.
- Update module dependencies when shared libraries change.

---

## 4. Integration & API Contracts
- All cross-module communication must use well-defined API contracts.
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for internal contracts.
- Validate contracts with contract tests.

---

## 5. CI/CD & Quality Gates
- Each module should have its own CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar).
- Pipelines must run unit, integration, and performance tests.
- Enforce linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier).
- Require code review and passing tests before merging.

---

## 6. Migration from Monolithic to Modular
- Migrate one module at a time.
- Copy relevant code from monolithic to the new module.
- Refactor to fit the modular interface and structure.
- Update all references and dependencies.
- Run all tests and validate functionality.

---

## 7. Best Practices
- Keep modules small and focused.
- Minimize dependencies between modules.
- Use shared libraries for common code.
- Write comprehensive tests.
- Document everything.
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Support
- Use the migration script for initial setup.
- Check the logs and CI output for errors.
- Consult the architecture and migration docs for guidance.
- Ask for help in the project chat or issue tracker.

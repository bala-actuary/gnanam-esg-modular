# RADF Testing & Validation â€” Detailed Design

## Purpose
Ensure the RADF is robust, correct, and reliable through comprehensive testing and validation at all levels.

---

## 1. Unit Testing
- Each core component (orchestrator, aggregation, plugins, config parser) must have unit tests
- Use `pytest` as the standard framework
- Mock model outputs and configs for isolated testing

---

## 2. Integration Testing
- End-to-end tests for full scenario runs (from config to aggregated output)
- Use real or synthetic model plugins
- Validate correct execution, error handling, and logging

---

## 3. Scenario Validation
- Validate scenario config files for:
  - Schema compliance
  - Dependency graph correctness (no cycles, all ids valid)
  - Required fields present
- Use JSON Schema or custom validation logic

---

## 4. Test Data
- Provide sample configs and model outputs in `tests/data/`
- Include both valid and invalid cases
- Use for regression and edge case testing

---

## 5. CI Integration
- All tests must run automatically in CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- Fail build on test failure or coverage drop
- (Future) Integrate with code quality tools (linting, type checks)

## 6. Review Checklist
- [ ] Are all core components covered by unit tests?
- [ ] Are integration tests comprehensive?
- [ ] Is scenario validation robust?
- [ ] Is test data sufficient for edge cases?
- [ ] Is CI integration in place?

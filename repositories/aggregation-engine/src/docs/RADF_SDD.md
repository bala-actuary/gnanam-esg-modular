# Risk Aggregation & Dependency Framework (RADF) - Software Design Document (SDD)

## 1. Architecture Overview
- Modular, plugin-based core
- Orchestrator module for dependency resolution and model execution
- Aggregation engine with pluggable methods
- Config-driven (YAML/JSON) and (future) UI-driven workflows
- API endpoints for all major functions

## 2. Data Contracts
- All models must implement a standardized Pydantic schema for input/output
- Base schema: model_name, scenario_id, time_grid, paths, risk_measures, metadata
- Support for model-specific extensions

## 3. Dependency Mapping & Orchestration
- Dependencies defined in config file (YAML/JSON)
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure for model execution order
- Orchestrator parses config, resolves dependencies, runs models, passes outputs
- Handles missing data, errors, and retries

## 4. Aggregation Engine
- Registry of aggregation methods (sum, VaR, ES, custom)
- Pluggable: easy to add new aggregation functions
- Handles different time grids/paths via alignment/interpolation
- Outputs standardized results (JSON, CSV)

## 5. Extensibility & Plugin System
- New models and aggregation methods registered via entry points
- Clear interface for adding plugins
- Auto-discovery of new components

## 6. Error Handling, Logging, and Audit
- All runs, configs, and results logged with timestamps and user info
- Errors captured and reported with context
- Audit logs exportable for compliance

## 7. API and UI Design
- REST API for scenario submission, monitoring, and result retrieval
- (Future) Web UI for scenario setup, dependency mapping, and results visualization

## 8. Testing and Validation Strategy
- Unit tests for orchestrator, aggregation, and plugins
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Performance and security tests
- Automated test suite with CI/CD integration

## 9. Documentation
- All components and workflows documented for both technical and non-technical users
- Example configs, API usage, and troubleshooting included

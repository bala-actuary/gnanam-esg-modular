### **Internal User Guide (Draft): Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Model for Foreign Exchange Risk**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 28 June 2025
**Purpose:** This document describes how to use the `FXGBMModel` plugin, focusing on its dual interface for both file-based and in-memory data operations.

---

### **1. Overview**

The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model is a continuous-time stochastic process used to model the random walk of exchange rates. It assumes that the logarithm of the exchange rate follows a Brownian motion with drift, incorporating domestic and foreign risk-free rates.

Using the model primarily involves:
1.  **Prepare Input Data:** Provide parameters for the FX GBM process, either through a CSV file or directly in memory.
2.  **Run Simulation:** Generate future exchange rate paths based on the provided parameters.

---

### **2. Data Input and Output**

The model offers two primary ways to interact with data:

**A. File-Based I/O (Convenience for Standalone Use)**
For ease of use and to avoid hardcoding, the model can read its inputs from and write its outputs to a standardized directory structure.

*   **Input Directory:** `RiskModels/data/inputs/fx_gbm_model/`
*   **Output Directory:** `RiskModels/data/outputs/fx_gbm_model/`

#### **Input File Formats**

The model expects the following CSV file in the input directory:

**a) `fx_gbm_parameters.csv`**
*   **Purpose:** Defines the input parameters for the FX GBM simulation.
*   **Format:** A CSV file with a single row and the following columns:
    *   `Initial_Exchange_Rate`: The starting exchange rate (S0).
    *   `Domestic_Risk_Free_Rate`: The annualized domestic risk-free interest rate (r_d).
    *   `Foreign_Risk_Free_Rate`: The annualized foreign risk-free interest rate (r_f).
    *   `Volatility`: The annualized volatility (sigma).
    *   `Time_Horizon`: The total time period for the simulation (T, in years).
    *   `Num_Time_Steps`: The number of discrete time steps within the time horizon (N).
    *   `Num_Paths`: The number of simulation paths to generate (M).

    ```csv
    Initial_Exchange_Rate,Domestic_Risk_Free_Rate,Foreign_Risk_Free_Rate,Volatility,Time_Horizon,Num_Time_Steps,Num_Paths
    1.10,0.05,0.02,0.15,1,252,1000
    ```

#### **Output File Format**

The model saves its primary simulation results and generated plots to the output directory.

**a) `simulated_exchange_rates.csv`**
*   **Purpose:** Stores the generated future exchange rate paths.
*   **Format:** A CSV file where the first column is `Time` (in years) and subsequent columns are `Path_0`, `Path_1`, ..., `Path_M-1` for each simulated path.
    ```csv
    Time,Path_0,Path_1,...
    0.0,1.10,1.10,...
    0.003968,1.101,1.098,...
    ...
    ```

**b) `simulated_exchange_rate_paths.html`**
*   **Purpose:** An interactive HTML plot visualizing individual exchange rate paths over time.
*   **Format:** An HTML file that can be opened directly in a web browser.

**c) `exchange_rate_distribution_at_maturity.html`**
*   **Purpose:** An interactive HTML plot showing the distribution of exchange rates at the end of the simulation horizon.
*   **Format:** An HTML file that can be opened directly in a web browser.

**B. In-Memory Data (For Core Engine Integration)**
For direct integration with the Core Engine or other Python modules, the model also exposes internal logic methods that operate directly on in-memory data structures. This avoids file I/O overhead for real-time or programmatic use.

---

### **3. Step 1: Simulating Exchange Rates**

**Goal:** To generate a set of possible future exchange rate paths.

#### **A. Using File-Based Input (Public `simulate()` method)**

This is done by calling the public `simulate` method. It takes a `scenario_definition` dictionary as an argument, which can override parameters loaded from `fx_gbm_parameters.csv`. It will generate random shocks internally if `correlated_shocks` are not provided.

```python
from models.Foreign_Exchange_Risk.gbm_model.model import FXGBMModel

fx_gbm_model = FXGBMModel()

scenario_definition = {
    "initial_exchange_rate": 1.10,
    "domestic_risk_free_rate": 0.05,
    "foreign_risk_free_rate": 0.02,
    "volatility": 0.15,
    "time_horizon": 1.0,      # 1 year
    "num_time_steps": 252,    # Daily steps for 1 year
    "num_paths": 1000
}

# Example plot_options to enable only exchange rate paths plot
plot_options = {
    "exchange_rate_paths": {"enabled": True, "output_filename": "my_custom_fx_paths.html"},
    "exchange_rate_distribution_at_maturity": {"enabled": False} # Disable distribution plot
}

simulation_result = fx_gbm_model.simulate(scenario_definition, plot_options=plot_options)
```

If `plot_options` is not provided, default plots (exchange rate paths and distribution) will be generated. You can enable or disable specific plots and customize their output filenames. The method returns an `FXGBMSimulationResult` object for immediate in-memory use, and the primary output (`simulated_exchange_rates.csv`) along with the specified plots are saved to the output directory (`RiskModels/data/outputs/fx_gbm_model/`).

#### **B. In-Memory Output (Internal `_simulate_logic()` method)**

For direct programmatic control without file I/O, you can call the internal `_simulate_logic` method. This method requires an `FXGBMInputData` object and `correlated_shocks` (which must be provided, not generated internally).

```python
from models.Foreign_Exchange_Risk.gbm_model.model import FXGBMModel
from models.Foreign_Exchange_Risk.gbm_model.data_structures import FXGBMInputData

fx_gbm_model = FXGBMModel()

input_data = FXGBMInputData(
    initial_exchange_rate=1.10,
    domestic_risk_free_rate=0.05,
    foreign_risk_free_rate=0.02,
    volatility=0.15,
    time_horizon=1.0,
    num_time_steps=252,
    num_paths=1000
)

# Example of generating correlated shocks
num_timesteps = input_data.num_time_steps
num_paths = input_data.num_paths
correlated_shocks_array = np.random.standard_normal(size=(num_timesteps, num_paths))

simulation_result = fx_gbm_model._simulate_logic(input_data, correlated_shocks_array)
```

This method returns an `FXGBMSimulationResult` object directly, without saving any files.

#### **Output of Simulation**

Both methods return an `FXGBMSimulationResult` object. This object contains:

*   `paths`: A large table (NumPy array) of the simulated exchange rate paths.
*   `time_grid`: A list of the time points corresponding to the rows in the `paths` table.

You can now use this `paths` table for further analysis, pricing, and other calculations.

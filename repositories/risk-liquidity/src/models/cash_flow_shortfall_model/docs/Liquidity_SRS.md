# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
### Model Plugin: Cash Flow Shortfall Model for Liquidity Risk
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 28 June 2025

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the **Cash Flow Shortfall Model Plugin** within the "RiskModels" platform. It details the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the model's implementation and calculation capabilities for liquidity risk.

#### 1.2 Scope
This SRS covers the Cash Flow Shortfall Model's core functionality, including its ability to project cash inflows and outflows over a specified horizon and identify potential liquidity shortfalls. It will integrate with the platform's data access layer for input and output, and leverage the visualization module for graphical representation of results.

## 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1. Model Calculation
*   **FR1.1 - Input Data:** The model shall accept as input:
    *   Historical or projected cash inflows (e.g., premiums, investment income, asset sales).
    *   Historical or projected cash outflows (e.g., claims, expenses, debt service).
    *   Time horizon for projection.
    *   Frequency of projection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
*   **FR1.2 - Calculation Output:** The model shall calculate and output:
    *   Net cash flow for each period.
    *   Cumulative net cash flow.
    *   Identified liquidity shortfalls (periods where cumulative net cash flow is negative).

#### 2.2. Data Handling
*   **FR2.1 - Hybrid I/O:** The model shall support both file-based (CSV) and in-memory data handling for inputs and outputs.
*   **FR2.2 - Input File Format:** The model shall expect input data in a predefined CSV format (e.g., `cash_flows.csv` with columns for `Date`, `Inflows`, `Outflows`).
*   **FR2.3 - Output File Format:** The model shall output calculated results (e.g., net cash flow, cumulative cash flow, shortfalls) to CSV files with clear, labeled columns.

#### 2.3. Visualization
*   **FR3.1 - Graphical Output:** The model shall generate interactive plots (e.g., net cash flow over time, cumulative cash flow with shortfall indicators) using the platform's visualization module. Users shall be able to configure which plots are generated.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.1. Performance
*   **NFR3.1.1 - Calculation Speed:** Calculation of cash flows should be efficient for typical input sizes.

#### 3.2. Accuracy
*   **NFR3.2.1 - Calculation Accuracy:** All calculations shall adhere to standard accounting and financial principles.
*   **NFR3.2.2 - Validation:** The model's outputs shall be validated against manually calculated examples or benchmark data where available.

#### 3.3. Usability
*   **NFR3.3.1 - Clear Interface:** The model's public interface shall be intuitive and consistent with the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **NFR3.3.2 - Documentation:** Comprehensive internal and external documentation shall be provided.

#### 3.4. Maintainability
*   **NFR3.4.1 - Modularity:** The codebase shall be modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., data processing, calculation logic).
*   **NFR3.4.2 - Testability:** All components shall be unit-testable.

#### 3.5. Security
*   **NFR3.5.1 - Data Security:** The model shall not expose sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.

## 4. Constraints

*   **C4.1 - Programming Language:** Python.
*   **C4.2 - Core Engine Integration:** Must adhere to the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **C4.3 - Data Formats:** CSV for file-based I/O.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   Integration with stochastic cash flow projections.
*   Incorporation of liquidity buffers and contingent funding sources.
*   Advanced visualization options for stress testing scenarios.

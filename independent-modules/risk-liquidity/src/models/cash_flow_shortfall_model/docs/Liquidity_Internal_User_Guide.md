### **Internal User Guide (Draft): Cash Flow Shortfall Model**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 28 June 2025
**Purpose:** This document describes how to use the `CashFlowShortfallModel` plugin, focusing on its dual interface for both file-based and in-memory data operations.

---

### **1. Overview**

The Cash Flow Shortfall Model is a tool for assessing liquidity risk by projecting cash inflows and outflows over a specified period. It identifies potential shortfalls where cumulative outflows exceed cumulative inflows, indicating a need for additional liquidity.

Using the model primarily involves:
1.  **Prepare Input Data:** Provide historical or projected cash flow data, either through a CSV file or directly in memory.
2.  **Run Calculation:** Calculate net cash flows, cumulative cash flows, and identify shortfalls.

---

### **2. Data Input and Output**

The model offers two primary ways to interact with data:

**A. File-Based I/O (Convenience for Standalone Use)**
For ease of use and to avoid hardcoding, the model can read its inputs from and write its outputs to a standardized directory structure.

*   **Input Directory:** `RiskModels/data/inputs/liquidity_model/`
*   **Output Directory:** `RiskModels/data/outputs/liquidity_model/`

#### **Input File Formats**

The model expects the following CSV file in the input directory:

**a) `cash_flows.csv`**
*   **Purpose:** Defines the cash inflows and outflows over time.
*   **Format:** A CSV file with the following columns:
    *   `Date`: The date or period identifier (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `Inflows`: Cash received during the period.
    *   `Outflows`: Cash paid out during the period.

    ```csv
    Date,Inflows,Outflows
    2025-01-31,1000,800
    2025-02-28,1200,1500
    2025-03-31,900,700
    ```

#### **Output File Format**

The model saves its primary calculation results and generated plots to the output directory.

**a) `cash_flow_results.csv`**
*   **Purpose:** Stores the calculated net cash flow, cumulative cash flow, and identified shortfalls.
*   **Format:** A CSV file with the original input columns plus:
    *   `Net_Cash_Flow`: `Inflows - Outflows`.
    *   `Cumulative_Cash_Flow`: Running total of `Net_Cash_Flow`.
    *   `Shortfall`: Boolean (True if `Cumulative_Cash_Flow` is negative, False otherwise).

    ```csv
    Date,Inflows,Outflows,Net_Cash_Flow,Cumulative_Cash_Flow,Shortfall
    2025-01-31,1000,800,200,200,False
    2025-02-28,1200,1500,-300,-100,True
    2025-03-31,900,700,200,100,False
    ```

**b) `net_cash_flow_plot.html`**
*   **Purpose:** An interactive HTML plot visualizing the net cash flow for each period.
*   **Format:** An HTML file that can be opened directly in a web browser.

**c) `cumulative_cash_flow_plot.html`**
*   **Purpose:** An interactive HTML plot visualizing the cumulative cash flow over time, highlighting periods of shortfall.
*   **Format:** An HTML file that can be opened directly in a web browser.

**B. In-Memory Data (For Core Engine Integration)**
For direct integration with the Core Engine or other Python modules, the model also exposes internal logic methods that operate directly on in-memory data structures. This avoids file I/O overhead for real-time or programmatic use.

### **3. Step 1: Calculating Cash Flow Shortfall**

**Goal:** To calculate and identify potential liquidity shortfalls.

#### **A. Using File-Based Input (Public `calculate()` method)**

This is done by calling the public `calculate` method. It can take an optional `scenario_definition` dictionary (for future use, e.g., filtering data) and `plot_options`.

```python
from models.Liquidity_Risk.cash_flow_shortfall_model.model import CashFlowShortfallModel

liquidity_model = CashFlowShortfallModel()

# Example plot_options to enable only cumulative cash flow plot
plot_options = {
    "net_cash_flow_plot": {"enabled": False},
    "cumulative_cash_flow_plot": {"enabled": True, "output_filename": "my_custom_cumulative_cf.html"}
}

results = liquidity_model.calculate(plot_options=plot_options)
```

If `plot_options` is not provided, default plots (net cash flow and cumulative cash flow) will be generated. You can enable or disable specific plots and customize their output filenames. The method returns a `CashFlowResults` object for immediate in-memory use, and the primary output (`cash_flow_results.csv`) along with the specified plots are saved to the output directory (`RiskModels/data/outputs/liquidity_model/`).

#### **B. In-Memory Output (Internal `_calculate_logic()` method)**

For direct programmatic control without file I/O, you can call the internal `_calculate_logic` method. This method requires a `CashFlowInputData` object.

```python
from models.Liquidity_Risk.cash_flow_shortfall_model.model import CashFlowShortfallModel
from models.Liquidity_Risk.cash_flow_shortfall_model.data_structures import CashFlowInputData
import pandas as pd

liquidity_model = CashFlowShortfallModel()

# Example of in-memory input data
input_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': pd.to_datetime(['2025-01-31', '2025-02-28', '2025-03-31']),
    'Inflows': [1000, 1200, 900],
    'Outflows': [800, 1500, 700]
})
input_data = CashFlowInputData(cash_flows_df=input_df)

results = liquidity_model._calculate_logic(input_data)

print(results.results_df)
```

This method returns a `CashFlowResults` object directly, without saving any files.

#### **Output of Calculation**

Both methods return a `CashFlowResults` object. This object contains:

*   `results_df`: A Pandas DataFrame with the original input data plus calculated `Net_Cash_Flow`, `Cumulative_Cash_Flow`, and `Shortfall` columns.

You can now use this DataFrame for further analysis and reporting.

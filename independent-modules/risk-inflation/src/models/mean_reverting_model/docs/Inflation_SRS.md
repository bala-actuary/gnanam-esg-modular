# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
### Model Plugin: Mean-Reverting Inflation Model
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 28 June 2025

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the **Mean-Reverting Inflation Model Plugin** within the "RiskModels" platform. It details the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the model's implementation and simulation capabilities for inflation rates.

#### 1.2 Scope
This SRS covers the Mean-Reverting Inflation Model's core functionality, including its ability to simulate future inflation rates that tend to revert to a long-term mean. It will integrate with the platform's data access layer for input and output, and leverage the visualization module for graphical representation of results.

## 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1. Model Simulation
*   **FR1.1 - Input Data:** The model shall accept as input:
    *   Initial Inflation Rate (I0)
    *   Long-Term Mean Inflation Rate (theta)
    *   Mean Reversion Speed (kappa)
    *   Volatility (sigma)
    *   Time Horizon (T)
    *   Number of Time Steps (N)
    *   Number of Simulation Paths (M)
*   **FR1.2 - Simulation Output:** The model shall simulate and output:
    *   Simulated inflation rate paths over the specified time horizon.

#### 2.2. Data Handling
*   **FR2.1 - Hybrid I/O:** The model shall support both file-based (CSV) and in-memory data handling for inputs and outputs.
*   **FR2.2 - Input File Format:** The model shall expect input data in a predefined CSV format (e.g., `inflation_parameters.csv` with columns for I0, theta, kappa, sigma, T, N, M).
*   **FR2.3 - Output File Format:** The model shall output simulated paths to CSV files with clear, labeled columns.

#### 2.3. Visualization
*   **FR3.1 - Graphical Output:** The model shall generate interactive plots (e.g., simulated inflation rate paths, distribution of inflation rates at maturity) using the platform's visualization module. Users shall be able to configure which plots are generated.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.1. Performance
*   **NFR3.1.1 - Simulation Speed:** Simulation of inflation rate paths should be efficient to support a large number of paths and time steps.

#### 3.2. Accuracy
*   **NFR3.2.1 - Calculation Accuracy:** All calculations shall adhere to industry-standard numerical precision for financial models.
*   **NFR3.2.2 - Validation:** The model's outputs shall be validated against known analytical properties of mean-reverting processes.

#### 3.3. Usability
*   **NFR3.3.1 - Clear Interface:** The model's public interface shall be intuitive and consistent with the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **NFR3.3.2 - Documentation:** Comprehensive internal and external documentation shall be provided.

#### 3.4. Maintainability
*   **NFR3.4.1 - Modularity:** The codebase shall be modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., formulas, model logic).
*   **NFR3.4.2 - Testability:** All components shall be unit-testable.

#### 3.5. Security
*   **NFR3.5.1 - Data Security:** The model shall not expose sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.

## 4. Constraints

*   **C4.1 - Programming Language:** Python.
*   **C4.2 - Core Engine Integration:** Must adhere to the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **C4.3 - Data Formats:** CSV for file-based I/O.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   Extension to include jumps or other stochastic features.
*   Integration with market data feeds for parameter estimation.
*   Advanced visualization options.

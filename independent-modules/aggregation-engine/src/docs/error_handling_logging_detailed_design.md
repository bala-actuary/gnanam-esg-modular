# RADF Error Handling & Logging â€” Detailed Design

## Purpose
Ensure robust, auditable, and user-friendly error handling and logging throughout the RADF, supporting compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Error Types & Handling
- **Model Execution Errors:**
  - If a model fails (exception, invalid output):
    - Log error with model id, inputs, error message, and stack trace
    - Optionally retry (configurable)
    - If critical, halt workflow and report failure
- **Dependency Errors:**
  - If a required dependency is missing or failed:
    - Log and halt with a clear error message
- **Config/Validation Errors:**
  - If config is invalid (missing fields, circular dependencies):
    - Log and halt with a clear error message
- **Aggregation Errors:**
  - If aggregation fails (e.g., incompatible data):
    - Log error, skip or halt as configured

---

## 2. Logging Strategy
- All actions, errors, and results are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - User (if available)
  - Action type (model run, aggregation, error, etc.)
  - Model/aggregation id
  - Inputs/outputs (summarized)
  - Status (success/failure)
- Logs are written to:
  - Console (for real-time monitoring)
  - Log file (rotating, e.g., `radf.log`)
  - (Optional) Structured log format (JSON) for audit/compliance

---

## 3. Audit Trail Requirements
- Every scenario run, config change, and result must be logged
- Audit logs must be exportable (CSV/JSON)
- (Future) Support for immutable/append-only audit logs

---

## 4. Extensibility
- Logging and error handling can be extended via plugins or custom handlers
- (Future) Integration with enterprise logging/monitoring systems (e.g., ELK, Prometheus)

---

## 5. Example Log Entry (JSON)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T12:34:56Z",
  "user": "alice",
  "action": "model_run",
  "model_id": "hw1f",
  "inputs": {"num_paths": 1000, "time_horizon": 1.0},
  "status": "success"
}
```

## 6. Review Checklist
- [ ] Are all error types and handling strategies covered?
- [ ] Is the logging/audit approach robust and compliant?
- [ ] Is extensibility for future needs considered?

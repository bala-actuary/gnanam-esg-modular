# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
### Model Plugin: Merton Model for Credit Risk
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 28 June 2025

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the **Merton Model Plugin** within the "RiskModels" platform. It details the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the model's implementation, calibration, and simulation capabilities.

#### 1.2 Scope
This SRS covers the Merton Model's core functionality, including its ability to calculate default probability and credit spreads based on a firm's asset value, asset volatility, and debt structure. It will integrate with the platform's data access layer for input and output, and leverage the visualization module for graphical representation of results.

## 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1. Model Calibration
*   **FR1.1 - Input Data:** The model shall accept as input:
    *   Firm's Equity Value (E)
    *   Firm's Equity Volatility (σ_E)
    *   Face Value of Debt (F)
    *   Time to Maturity of Debt (T)
    *   Risk-Free Rate (r)
*   **FR1.2 - Calibration Output:** The model shall calibrate and output:
    *   Implied Firm Asset Value (V_A)
    *   Implied Firm Asset Volatility (σ_A)

#### 2.2. Default Probability Calculation
*   **FR2.1 - Default Probability:** The model shall calculate the probability of default (PD) based on the calibrated asset value and volatility, face value of debt, time to maturity, and risk-free rate.

#### 2.3. Credit Spread Calculation
*   **FR3.1 - Credit Spread:** The model shall calculate the credit spread associated with the firm's debt.

#### 2.4. Simulation
*   **FR4.1 - Asset Value Simulation:** The model shall simulate future firm asset values using Geometric Brownian Motion.
    *   **FR4.1.1 - Simulation Inputs:** The `simulate` method shall accept `scenario_definition` (time horizon, number of time steps, number of paths) and optionally `correlated_shocks`.
    *   **FR4.1.2 - Simulation Output:** The `simulate` method shall output simulated asset value paths.
*   **FR4.2 - Default Path Determination:** Based on simulated asset values, the model shall determine default events over the simulation horizon by comparing asset value to debt value.
*   **FR4.3 - Output File Format:** The model shall output simulated paths to CSV files with clear, labeled columns.

#### 2.5. Data Handling
*   **FR5.1 - Hybrid I/O:** The model shall support both file-based (CSV) and in-memory data handling for inputs and outputs.
*   **FR5.2 - Input File Format:** The model shall expect input data in a predefined CSV format (e.g., `firm_data.csv` with columns for E, σ_E, F, T, r).
*   **FR5.3 - Output File Format:** The model shall output results (e.g., PD, Credit Spread, simulated paths) to CSV files with clear, labeled columns.

#### 2.6. Visualization
*   **FR6.1 - Graphical Output:** The model shall generate interactive plots (e.g., asset value paths, default probability over time) using the platform's visualization module. Users shall be able to configure which plots are generated.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.1. Performance
*   **NFR3.1.1 - Calibration Speed:** Calibration should complete within acceptable timeframes for typical input sizes.
*   **NFR3.1.2 - Simulation Speed:** Simulation of asset paths should be efficient to support a large number of paths and time steps.

#### 3.2. Accuracy
*   **NFR3.2.1 - Calculation Accuracy:** All calculations shall adhere to industry-standard numerical precision for financial models.
*   **NFR3.2.2 - Validation:** The model's outputs shall be validated against known analytical solutions or benchmark data where available.

#### 3.3. Usability
*   **NFR3.3.1 - Clear Interface:** The model's public interface shall be intuitive and consistent with the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **NFR3.3.2 - Documentation:** Comprehensive internal and external documentation shall be provided.

#### 3.4. Maintainability
*   **NFR3.4.1 - Modularity:** The codebase shall be modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., formulas, pricing, model logic).
*   **NFR3.4.2 - Testability:** All components shall be unit-testable.

#### 3.5. Security
*   **NFR3.5.1 - Data Security:** The model shall not expose sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.

## 4. Constraints

*   **C4.1 - Programming Language:** Python.
*   **C4.2 - Core Engine Integration:** Must adhere to the `ModelInterface` contract.
*   **C4.3 - Data Formats:** CSV for file-based I/O.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   Extension to multi-period default probabilities.
*   Integration with market data feeds for real-time calibration.
*   Advanced visualization options.
